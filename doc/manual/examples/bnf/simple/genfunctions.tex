\subsubsection{Generated Functions}
The files that are generated by gt for this grammar start with \textit{simple}. For example, the equality function
is called \textit{simple\_eq.ml} which is shown below. The equality function takes in a 
pair and returns true if the two elements in the pair are equal otherwise it returns false. The type for the equality 
function is $ ('a * 'a) \rightarrow bool $. \\
\lstinputlisting[language=ML]{./examples/bnf/simple/simple_eq.ml}\ \\

\noindent Another file that is outputted by gt is the file containing the pretty printer function.
As the name implies, pretty printer helps print the parsed program in a readable format. Instead of
printing out the text that the generated parser has after creating the syntax trees, this function 
preserves the newlines of the original file. However, the pretty printer does not preserve 
comments, tabs or spaces. Below is the pretty printer definition for this example, \textit{simple\_pp.ml}.\\

\noindent The following is the output for the function that creates a Graph-Viz file. This function
will create a visual representation of a syntax tree for a program that is parseable by the generated 
parser. \\

\section{EBNF Notation}
Besides basic BNF support, gt also supports context-free grammars with EBNF notation. A user is able to define a 
production that has optional and repetitive types. The optional type allows an element(s) to have one or none and
the repetitve feature allows element(s) to be zero or many, one or many or n or many
where n is a non-negative integer. With the repetitive types a user can also define 
whether it is left or right associative.  Gt's syntax for EBNF notation is explained below.

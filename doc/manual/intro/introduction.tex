%\section{Motivation}
OCamlyacc generates a parser from a set rules that are defined by the user in syntax similar to BNF, and OCamllex 
translates a set of regular expressions to a lexical analyzer. The goal of gt is to allow the user to easily 
define a context-free grammar in one file and then generate the corresponding parser, lexical analyzer and syntax
trees based on the rules defined in the file. In addition, gt adds support for EBNF notation. Here is an example 
of an input file: \\
\begin{gt} 
lists

Grammar : grammar -> { olist }*.

OList : olist -> LSBRACKET [ element { SEMI element }* ] RSBRACKET.

Element :  element -> VAR | INT.

LSBRACKET = "[".
RSBRACKET = "]".
SEMI = ";".

VAR = {{ ['a'-'z''A'-'Z'] ['a'-'z''A'-'Z''0'-'9''_']* }}.
INT = {{ ['0'-'9']+ }}.
\end{gt}\ \\
Gt takes a file in the format shown above and generates multiple OCaml source files, as show in Figure 1.1. These
files can then be compiled to an executable.

\end{figure}\ \\
After the files in Figure 1.1 are compiled the executable is ready to parse programs such as, [ 0 ; a ; 1 ], to
syntax trees like the one shown in Figure 1.2. The syntax tree in Figure 1.2 was actually generated, in Graph-viz
format, by the same executable.

Along with the ability to easily generate parsers, gt generates many useful functions. For example dump\_gviz,
which creates a Graph-Viz file containing a syntax tree definition for a given parseable file. The file names listed below are 
some of names corresponding to the gt generated files. Below the keyword \textit{grammar\_name} refers to the name of the 
grammar. For example, for the definition above \textit{grammar\_name} would would refer to lists \textit{lists}.
